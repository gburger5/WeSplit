- My First Swift/SwiftUI Project
- Adadpted for Personal Liking from the 100 Days of SwiftUI Challenge

WeSplit:
- A check splitting app that allows you to input the cost of the bill, confirm the number of people at the table, add a tip percentage, and gives you the grand total and amount per person.
- This app allowed me to hone the basics of Swift/SwiftUI that I have been learning, and experiment with more complex concepts such as closures, structs, and views.
